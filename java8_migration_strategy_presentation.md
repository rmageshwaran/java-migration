### Proposed Microservices (Based on DDD Analysis)
```
1. Device Management Service    - Device lifecycle and metadata
2. Data Ingestion Service      - High-throughput IoT data intake
3. Telemetry Processing Service - Real-time data transformation
4. Alerting Service           - Rule-based notification system
5. User Management Service     - Authentication and authorization
6. Reporting Service          - Analytics and dashboard data
```

### Technology Stack (Self-Hosted)
• **Runtime:** Java 17+ with Spring Boot 3.x (leveraging existing skills)
• **Orchestration:** Kubernetes for container management
• **Event Streaming:** Apache Kafka for async communication
• **Databases:** 
  - PostgreSQL (transactional data)
  - InfluxDB (time-series IoT data)
  - Redis (caching and sessions)
• **Observability:** Prometheus + Grafana + EFK Stack + Jaeger
