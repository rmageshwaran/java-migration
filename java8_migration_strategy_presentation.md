### Slide 6: Vision - Target Architecture
**From Monolith to Microservices Excellence**

**Before: Monolithic Constraints**
```
[IoT Devices] → [Load Balancer] → [Java 8 Monolith] → [Single Database]
                                        ↓
                               [Manual Deployments]
```

**After: Cloud-Native Microservices**
```
[IoT Devices] → [API Gateway] → [Service Mesh]
                                      ↓
         [Device Mgmt] [Data Ingestion] [Stream Processing]
         [User Mgmt]   [Reporting]     [Notifications]
                                      ↓
              [Event Streaming - Kafka]
                                      ↓
         [Time-Series DB] [Document Store] [Relational DB]
```

**Key Transformation:**
- **Runtime:** Java 8 → Java 21 LTS
- **Architecture:** Monolith → Event-driven microservices  
- **Infrastructure:** Traditional → Kubernetes-native
- **Data:** Single DB → Polyglot persistence

| **Monitoring** | Basic logging | Full Observability | Proactive issue detection |
| **Deployment** | Manual process | CI/CD Pipeline | Automated, zero-downtime |

---

### Slide 8: Service Decomposition Strategy
**Microservices Design - Domain-Driven**

**Core Services Architecture:**
```
┌─────────────────┐  ┌─────────────────┐  ┌─────────────────┐
│  Device Mgmt    │  │  Data Ingestion │  │ Stream Process  │
│                 │  │                 │  │                 │
│ • Registration  │  │ • Validation    │  │ • Real-time     │
│ • Configuration │  │ • Transformation│  │ • Analytics     │
│ • Lifecycle     │  │ • Protocol      │  │ • Anomaly Det.  │
└─────────────────┘  └─────────────────┘  └─────────────────┘

┌─────────────────┐  ┌─────────────────┐  ┌─────────────────┐
│  User Mgmt      │  │   Reporting     │  │  Notification   │
│                 │  │                 │  │                 │
│ • Authentication│  │ • Dashboards    │  │ • Alerts        │
│ • Authorization │  │ • Historical    │  │ • Events        │
│ • Multi-tenancy │  │ • Export        │  │ • Integration   │
└─────────────────┘  └─────────────────┘  └─────────────────┘
```

**Design Principles:**
- **Single Responsibility:** Each service owns one domain
- **Independent Deployment:** No shared databases or code
- **API-First:** Well-defined service contracts
- **Event-Driven:** Loose coupling through events
