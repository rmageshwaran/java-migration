# Migration Strategy: From Java 8 Monolith to Cloud-Native Microservices

## Executive Summary

This document outlines a strategy for modernizing the existing Java 8 monolithic IoT application. The goal is to migrate towards a cloud-native, microservice-based architecture to address challenges in maintainability, scalability, and deployment. This evolution will result in a more resilient, flexible, and scalable platform, enabling faster delivery of new features.

The proposed strategy is centered around an incremental, risk-mitigated approach using the Strangler Fig pattern. We will progressively build out new capabilities as microservices while continuing to leverage the existing monolith, ensuring business continuity.

A key consideration is the requirement for an intranet-based deployment with no external internet connectivity. All technology and architectural recommendations are made with this constraint in mind, focusing on self-hosted and on-premise solutions.

## 1. Discovery & Analysis Phase

**Objective:** To gain a deep understanding of the existing system, its business context, and technical implementation before starting the migration.

*   **Business Capability Mapping:**
    *   Collaborate with product owners and business stakeholders to identify and map the core business capabilities of the application.
    *   Utilize techniques from Domain-Driven Design (DDD), such as Event Storming, to define Bounded Contexts. These contexts will serve as the primary candidates for our future microservices.
    *   Example contexts for an IoT platform might include: Device Management, Data Ingestion, Telemetry Processing, Alerting, User Management, Reporting.

*   **Technical Assessment:**
    *   **Codebase Analysis:**
        *   Analyze module dependencies, data models, and API contracts within the monolith.
        *   Identify "seams" in the code—areas with low coupling that are easier to extract.
        *   Use static analysis tools to visualize dependencies and complexity.
    *   **Data Architecture Review:**
        *   Map the existing database schema and identify data ownership boundaries.
        *   Analyze data flow for IoT devices, from ingestion to processing and storage.
        *   Identify key data entities and their relationships across different parts of the application.
    *   **Operational & Infrastructure Analysis:**
        *   Document the current build, testing, and deployment processes.
        *   Review existing monitoring, logging, and alerting mechanisms.
        *   Understand the current infrastructure and resource utilization.

*   **Identify Key Pain Points:**
    *   Pinpoint specific areas of the application that are difficult to change, scale, or deploy.
    *   Identify performance bottlenecks and reliability issues.
    *   This analysis will help prioritize which parts of the monolith to "strangle" first.

## 2. Target Architecture

**Objective:** Define the principles and components of the future-state microservices architecture.

*   **Architectural Principles:**
    *   **Single Responsibility & Bounded Context:** Each microservice will align with a specific business capability (a Bounded Context).
    *   **Loose Coupling:** Services communicate over well-defined APIs and asynchronous events, minimizing direct dependencies.
    *   **High Cohesion:** Components within a service are closely related and focused on a single purpose.
    *   **Decentralized Data:** Each microservice owns and manages its own data, choosing the database technology that best fits its needs (Polyglot Persistence).
    *   **Design for Failure:** The system will be designed to be resilient, gracefully handling failures in individual services.
    *   **Automation:** Extensive automation of builds, testing, deployments, and infrastructure management (Infrastructure as Code).

*   **Core Components for an Intranet Environment:**
    *   **Containerization & Orchestration:**
        *   **Docker:** To package services and their dependencies into portable containers.
        *   **Kubernetes:** To automate the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications on-premise.
    *   **API Gateway:**
        *   A single, unified entry point for all external clients.
        *   Responsibilities: Request routing, authentication/authorization, rate limiting, and SSL termination.
        *   *Self-hosted options: Kong, Spring Cloud Gateway.*
    *   **Service Mesh (Optional but Recommended):**
        *   To manage inter-service communication, providing reliability (retries, timeouts), security (mTLS), and observability.
        *   *Self-hosted options: Istio, Linkerd.*
    *   **Event-Driven Backbone:**
        *   For asynchronous communication between services, crucial for decoupling and scaling IoT data processing.
        *   *Self-hosted options: Apache Kafka, RabbitMQ.*
    *   **Observability Stack:**
        *   **Logging:** Centralized logging for all services. (*EFK stack: Elasticsearch, Fluentd, Kibana*).
        *   **Metrics:** Time-series monitoring of application and system metrics. (*Prometheus & Grafana*).
        *   **Tracing:** Distributed tracing to understand request flows across multiple services. (*Jaeger, Zipkin*).
    *   **CI/CD Pipeline:**
        *   Automated pipelines for building, testing, and deploying each microservice independently.
        *   *Self-hosted options: Jenkins, GitLab CI.*
    *   **Private Container Registry:**
        *   To store and distribute Docker images within the intranet.
        *   *Self-hosted options: Harbor, Nexus Repository.*

## 3. Migration Strategy

**Recommendation:** The **Strangler Fig Pattern** is the most suitable approach for this migration. It is an incremental strategy that allows the new system to grow around the old one, minimizing risk and avoiding a "big bang" rewrite.

*   **The Process:**
    1.  **Identify the First Slice:** Choose a business capability to migrate. Good candidates are functionalities that are relatively self-contained or are currently a major pain point. For example, a "Device Provisioning" service.
    2.  **Build the New Microservice:** Develop the new service using the target architecture and technology stack. It will have its own codebase, CI/CD pipeline, and data store.
    3.  **Introduce the "Strangler" Façade:** This is typically the API Gateway. Initially, it might pass all traffic to the monolith.
    4.  **Redirect Traffic:** Configure the façade to route traffic for the newly implemented functionality to the new microservice. The monolith continues to handle all other requests. This can be done for a subset of users/devices initially to test in production.
    5.  **Expand and Repeat:** Continue identifying and migrating functionality from the monolith to new microservices, progressively "strangling" the monolith.
    6.  **Decommission:** Once all functionality has been migrated, the monolith can be safely decommissioned.

*   **Handling Data:**
    *   Data migration is often the most complex part. The approach will depend on the specific service.
    *   **Initial Stage:** The new service might initially read/write to the monolithic database to reduce complexity. This is a temporary measure.
    *   **Synchronization:** Implement data synchronization mechanisms (e.g., using Kafka Connect or change-data-capture) to move data from the monolith's database to the new service's database.
    *   **Data Ownership:** Once the new service is the single source of truth for its data, calls from the monolith can be redirected to the new service's API to access that data.

## 4. Key Challenges & Mitigations

*   **Challenge: Database Decomposition**
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   Start with a shared database model where acceptable, and move towards database-per-service over time.
        *   Use an event-driven approach to ensure eventual consistency between data stores.
        *   Invest heavily in data analysis and modeling during the discovery phase.

*   **Challenge: Managing Distributed Transactions**
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   Avoid distributed transactions where possible.
        *   Adopt the **Saga pattern** for long-running business processes that span multiple services. This pattern uses a sequence of local transactions and compensating actions to maintain data consistency.

*   **Challenge: Increased Operational Complexity**
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   Invest in a strong observability stack from day one.
        *   Embrace Infrastructure as Code (e.g., Terraform, Ansible) to manage the platform.
        *   Build a dedicated Platform Engineering team to provide the tools and infrastructure for product teams.

*   **Challenge: Cultural and Organizational Shift**
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   Adopt a DevOps mindset: "You build it, you run it."
        *   Restructure teams around business capabilities (Conway's Law), making them autonomous and responsible for their services' lifecycle.
        *   Provide training and support to help teams adapt to new technologies and processes.

## 5. Technology Stack Recommendations for an Intranet Environment

*   **Backend Services:**
    *   **Language/Framework:** **Java with Spring Boot** or **Quarkus**. This leverages the team's existing Java skills while using modern, lightweight frameworks designed for microservices.
*   **Databases (Polyglot Persistence):**
    *   **Relational:** **PostgreSQL** (general-purpose).
    *   **Time-Series:** **InfluxDB** or **TimescaleDB** (for storing and querying IoT sensor data).
    *   **NoSQL/Document:** **MongoDB** (for flexible data schemas, e.g., device metadata).
    *   **Caching:** **Redis** (for session storage and caching).
*   **Infrastructure & Platform:**
    *   **Orchestration:** **Kubernetes**.
    *   **API Gateway:** **Kong** or **Spring Cloud Gateway**.
    *   **Messaging:** **Apache Kafka**.
    *   **CI/CD:** **GitLab** (provides Git repository, CI/CD, and container registry in one self-hosted solution) or **Jenkins**.
*   **Observability:**
    *   **Metrics:** **Prometheus** & **Grafana**.
    *   **Logging:** **EFK Stack (Elasticsearch, Fluentd, Kibana)**.
    *   **Tracing:** **Jaeger**.

## 6. Team Structure & DevOps Culture

*   **Feature Teams:**
    *   Organize teams around business capabilities, not technical layers (e.g., "Data Processing Team" instead of "Database Team").
    *   Each team should be cross-functional, containing developers, QA, and operations expertise.
    *   These teams have end-to-end ownership of their microservices.

*   **Platform Team:**
    *   A dedicated team responsible for building and maintaining the underlying platform (Kubernetes, CI/CD, observability).
    *   The platform team's "customers" are the internal feature teams. Their goal is to enable feature teams to deliver value quickly and safely.

*   **Guilds / Communities of Practice:**
    *   Create cross-team groups focused on specific topics (e.g., Java, QA, Frontend) to share knowledge and establish best practices across the organization.
